Command Block (l4d_command_block) by Mystik Spiral

Left4Dead2 SourceMod plugin blocks client commands.
Blocks commands as specified in the ConVar "cb_list".

By default, the blocked commands are:

    pause/setpause/unpause: Could be spammed to crash connected clients.
    jointeam: Could be used to spawn additional bots and other exploits.
    go_away_from_keyboard: Blocks many different idle exploits, most notably redirecting witch on startle.
        It is suggested to lower the parameter "director_afk_timeout" since players can no longer manually go idle.
        In the server.cfg file, set "sm_cvar director_afk_timeout 20", the default is 45.

The list of commands to block must be comma separated with no spaces.
